My `Awesome Marble Game`.

This UE4 project uses blueprints to allow the player to guide a ball to the goal.

If the ball falls out of the map, the player loses.

If the ball reaches the goal, the player loses.

The level has a custom floor and custom walls that were built with geometry bushes with `additive` and `subtractive` operations.

The level uses box triggers with overlap events to detect when the ball reaches a collider.

Don't move the mouse too fast, or you'll lose.
